Problem Set - 1 : ToDo Lists

Rubric
This assignment is designed to reinforce your understanding of the following:
1. Core Elements such as Data Types, Variables, Branching, Iterations, Arrays etc.
2. Identify Objects, Its properties and behaviours.
3. Problem decomposition. Identifying the tiny objects and separating them from the main logic.
3. Use of Java API for handling Date related queries.

Of course you are maintaining the list of tasks that you have to complete by 
the end of the day or week or month or so. For that you need to maintain the 
list of tasks and whenever you refer to it, you will get reminded of that, 
otherwise you may be forgetting some of the tasks you have to perform. And you 
should automate this process so that the program will remind you which tasks are 
in pending.

Implement the ToDo List based on the following.

The ToDo List contains the list of tasks. Each task has the task name,
task description, due date, status of each task.

1. You can add task to your ToDo List
2. You can remove task from your ToDo List
3. You can update the status of the task. (Mark the task as complete, in progress or incomplete)
4. You can display all the pending / incomplete tasks from your ToDo List.
5. You can display all the tasks based on a particular date
6. You can find a task based on the task name.
7. You can get all the overdue tasks.
8. You can also display all the tasks.

And you can add more functionality to your ToDo list if you find it useful.

Hints: To handle the Date, you can use the following Java API:
1. SimpleDateFormat which is available in java.text 
2. Date which is available in java.util


Here is an example of getting the date.
Example : 1
// Uses the Date API
Date date = new Date();

// Uses the SimpleDateFormat to format the Date to dd/MM/yyyy
SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");

// Getting the Date in the form of a String
String strDate= formatter.format(date);
System.out.println(strDate);



Example 2:
//  Creating the formatter object based on dd/MM/yyyy
SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy");

//  Creating the date object based on specific date using SimpleDateFormat object.
Date date = formatter.parse("31/03/2015");

//  Converting the date to the required format.
String strDate = formatter.format(date);
System.out.println("Date is: "+strDate);
