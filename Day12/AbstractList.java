     * The goal for the list is to store items.
     * How are we going to store the items in the list?
     * An listay would be good. Right?
     * So, assume we are only going to have ints in the list
     * We need to create an listay of ints to store the items
     * added to the list.
     *
     * Create a variable of the type int[]
     * Use the private access specifier
     * Why private access specifier and why not public?
     * Well, we don't want the listay to be manipulated by
     * methods that are outside the List class.
     * If you allow methods outside the List class to manipulate
     * the listay then there is a possibility of having a corrupted
     * list i.e., a list with incorrect items.
     * This is not desirable and so having private access specifer
     * will protect the listay such corruption.
     * This is a hard concept to understand. Discuss with your mentor.

     * How about keeping track of the size of the list?
     * If you add 2 items to the list then the size should be 2.
     * Let's think about the size of the list by comparing it to the
     * length of the listay. Do they mean the same?
     * No, listay length signifies the maximum number of items
     * you can store in the list. Whereas, the size of the list
     * denotes the number of items in the list. Makes sense?
     * Here is an example:
     * listay = [1,2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
     * The length of the listay is 10 and size is 3.
     * This means you can store 10 items in the list and
     * currently it has 3 items.
     * So, to keep track of the size we need a variable called size
     * Again, we use private as we don't want that size variable
     * to be accessed by the methods that are outside of the List class.
